## Overview

We use GitHub for version control and collaboration. Each member works on their own branch, pushes changes to GitHub, creates pull requests for code review, and merges into the `main` branch after approval. This helps keep our codebase stable and organized.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>

text
2. Navigate into the project folder:
cd <repository_folder>

text
3. Install any dependencies (as per project setup).

---

## Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature, bugfix, or task:
git checkout -b <feature_or_task_name>

text
- Branch names should be descriptive, such as `feature-login` or `bugfix-api-error`.

---

## Committing Changes

- Stage your changes:
git add .

text
- Commit with a clear message:
git commit -m "Brief description of the change"

text

---

## Pushing Changes

- Push your branch to GitHub:
git push origin <branch_name>

text

---

## Pull Requests & Code Review

- Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch on GitHub.
- Request teammates to review your code.
- Address feedback and update the PR if required.
- Merge only after approvals and ensuring no conflicts.

---

## Keeping Your Branch Updated

Before starting work or pushing changes, sync your branch with the latest main branch:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <branch_name>
git merge main

text

Resolve any merge conflicts locally.

---

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If conflicts arise during a merge:
- Communicate with team members.
- Manually edit conflicting files.
- Add and commit the resolved files before pushing.

---

## Best Practices

- Commit early and often with meaningful messages.
- Avoid pushing directly to the `main` branch.
- Use Pull Requests for all changes.
- Review teammatesâ€™ Pull Requests thoroughly.
- Stay in communication to coordinate work effectively.
