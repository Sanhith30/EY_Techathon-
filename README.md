Each member clones the repository to their own machine using:

text
git clone <repo_url>
Create a New Branch

Every team member creates a feature branch (e.g., feature-ui, feature-backend, feature-ml, feature-docs):

text
git checkout -b <branch_name>
Work on Assigned Tasks

Code on your own branch. Add and commit changes frequently:

text
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
Push Changes to GitHub

Push your branch to the remote repository:

text
git push origin <branch_name>
Pull Requests & Code Review

On GitHub, open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch. Team members review and comment on each otherâ€™s code before approving.

Merge After Review

Once reviewed, merge the PR to main. Only one person merges at a time to avoid conflicts.

Sync Regularly

Before starting new work, pull the latest main branch to your local repo and update your feature branch:

text
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <branch_name>
git merge main
Repeat Steps 4-8

Continue updating, pushing, reviewing, and merging until the project is complete.
